 <p align = 'center' > Hi there, thanks for visiting my page ! 👋 </p>

My name is Massimiliano Sica and I am a computer engineering student at the [Polytecnic of Milan](https://www.polimi.it/en/) :books:. 

I am extremly passionate about Artificial Intelligence in all of its shades from both a technical and conceptual point of view and I am currently trying to give my humble contribution to the field by means of research and industrial collaborations. 

In my free time I love playing guitar :guitar: and to cooking :spaghetti:
